 Some people might say that the government should keep activating the war on drugs. However, I think the government need to make the drugs to be used legally. And there are three reasons why.

 First, the budget spending for enforcing drug policies is too high. According to the Chart from the Office of Management and Budget, we can see the federal budget for Drug Abuse Prevention and Control was just over a billion dollars in 1981. But the number had grown to 34.6 billion in 2020, which was ever 1000%. Since regulating on using drugs is not working well, I think the budget should be used on other ways like making rehabs, using them for education about drugs, etc.

  Second reason why is that the sentence for possessing drugs is too draconic, and I think it led to a mass incarceration and 'The New Jim Crow'. There are 2.3 million people incarcerated, and about 1/5 are locked up for a drug offense. According to the number of the U.S. drug arrests, there are six times as many arrests for drug possession as for drug sales. There are lots of victims who got addicted on drugs because of the prescription for a painkillers. I think the policy is useless with reducing the drug use since they could not be the kingpin on this game. 

 Finally, the government's way on acting toward people who had drug abuse arrestment should be changed. There is a famous experiment by Alexander Professor called 'Rat Park'.  A rat in a cage with no other community of rats, were offered two water bottles. One filled with just water, and the other one with heroin or cocaine added water. They found out that the lonely rat chose the later one and died because of the overdose. On the other way, they made a 'rat park', there were rats which were free to roam and play, to socialize and to have sex. They had the same water bottles, and the researchers found out that the rats in the 'rat park', didn't use the water with cocaine or heroin. This experiment is insisting that humans need to have a relationship, contacts between other people and it will led to no drug abuses. Instead of putting them into the jail strictly, the U.S. government should make their workplaces to gain a new life style and encourage them to be a part in the society. Also, this will have a positive effects on people who were willing to have drugs.
