These days, lots of big firms and even the government are using an AI chatbot instead of the call centre. Especially after the pandemic, many companies are reducing the portion of the call center. News are reporting that AI chatting services and AI call centers are distinguishing themselves nowadays. Also the outlook was positive. The advancement in technologies is very fast, and I totally welcome this changes for human’s convenience. However, I think there are some disadvantages in this fast changes. 

First, AI is not a perfect displacement. I had experienced an AI chatbot services from one company. I thought the AI chatbot system is fast and accurate for the people who are busy like me. However, while I was using it through the application, I was quite disappointed because the AI chatbot didn’t understood my problem, and just kept recommending other solutions which were not helpful. I needed the consultant who knows the way to solve, so I searched the call center number, which was a time wasting process. 

Second, the fast change makes some people hard to adapt. Some elderly people are hesitating to order from kiosks, the self ordering machine. Since they are having a hard time with using a machine, it is easy to take them for granted when they meet the AI chatbot services.

Finally, the data ethic problem is critical. On January, the AI chatbot system called 'Lee Luda' was a big issue in Korea. The problems were mostly about the data ethics. There were racial and sex related troubles after the company launched their new AI chatbot service. The data ethic is really important because it is directly showing the person's privacy. Therefore, there should be systematic classes for the sudden changes.
