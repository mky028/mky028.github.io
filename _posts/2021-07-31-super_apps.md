These days, it is hard to see people who don't use cell phone. Lots of people download the application whenever they need. Popular applications are now aiming to be a super app. A super app is a mobile app which allows a user to access several services. In South Korea, there is a famous super app called KaKaoTalk, which was launched with chatting service. It is now becoming a super app, which covers from hailing a cab to bank service. Super apps might be unfamiliar to people who were using an application for its only one service. However, I am supportive on this development of these mobile applications. And there are some reasons why.

First of all, super apps are very convenient. We can use various services by using only one application. It is very simple and quick for users. For example, because of the coronaviruses, whenever I go somewhere, I need to enter with my QR code to log myself. And I always click on KaKaoTalk app, and shake it to make a QR code. My brother and lots of my colleagues also use the same app to leave a mark. They say that it is easy and fast to use such service.

Second, it helps consumers and even retailers to easily get access to the market. For example, Coupang, one of the most popular market service app in South Korea, is becoming a huge hub between retailers and consumers. They advertised an early morning delivery system and because of this service, lots of Korean consumers joined the application. The increasement of the online application market made retailers to plunge into Coupang.

Finally, I think many companies will revitalize the market since they are willing to become a super app. Baedal Minjok is a delivery app commonly seen in Korean's mobile phone. People use this app whenever and wherever they want food. Coupang Eats, the food delivery app which Coupang made, promoted an OD(Own Delivery) system. Which made themselves differentiated with Baedal Minjok. And there are other food delivery applications to compete in the food delivery market. This situation revitalized the food market because the coronavirus made the restaurant owners and customers to stuck in their places.

In conclusion, I think super app will act in various advantage ways. They are very convenient and becoming a huge platform between customers and retailers. Also, by endeavoring themselves in making a super app helps the market to revitalize.
