# How The West Coast Drought Could Cause More ‘Water Wars’

Water scarcity is being a big issue for a long time. Some countries are already suffering from water shortages. In the video from CNBC, the western side of the U.S. is getting threatened. The water level is getting lower, which makes higher temperature, causing wildfire risks. This climate change also causes drought and makes fewer snowpacks. By this circumstance, it is uneasy to overcome and is hardly possible to take care of the economic system.  

I think environmental problems such as global warming and desertification are causing the water shortage. To prevent the problem to get bigger, I urge the government need to lead how to solve this problem actively.  
The government should manage environmental politics to encourage the participation of companies and citizens. There are many ways that companies and citizens can support environmental problem solutions.  

What companies can contribute to the water problem are followings:  
First, companies can take charge of pollutants from factories. Next, they have abilities to develop technologies such as desalination and managed aquifer recharge(MAR).  

What citizens can take an action are followings:  
Planting trees, reducing the power use of air conditioner, trying not to use disposables, taking public transportations, etc.  

Those actions from companies and citizens will be implemented well if the government establishes politics systematically. Furthermore, if the government gives some advantages to those who fulfill politics, other firms and citizens would follow them to get those advantages. This phenomenon will bring a good circulation relationship. Also, we could expect economic growth by exporting technologies or water to other countries.  

In conclusion, I think the government should lead companies and people to care about the water scarcity problem. By establishing policies regarding water shortage, firms and the public will carry out them even though it might be compulsory at first. But I am sure this will bring bigger and better effects to others.
