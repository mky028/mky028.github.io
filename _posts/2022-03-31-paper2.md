# A Knowledge-Based Model for Constructability Assessment of Buildings Design Using BIM
###### Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Computing in Civil and Building Engineering(ICCCBE 2020)

This paper introduces a decision support tool for design-stage assessment of design constructability.
By using this tool, authors propose that they can get benefits such as cost, time, project quality, safety, etc.

They suggest a framework consisting of three modules: Constructability Model(CM), Design Model(DM), and Assessment Model(AM).
The CM part, which is a knowledge-based model, formulates user-based knowledge. AEC System, Rules of Thumb, Complexity, and Location are the four main components. These will guide the AM in interpreting associated information from DM. DM is made by Revit and they use this model to extract features. And AM calculates the constructability score which is for the decision-making phase.

I thought this paper is using a high portion of information from the BIM model, which could be useful for my research. However, features were so many that I was curious whether they are all appropriate for decision-making. Also, it is hard to know the reason why they picked four components for this process.
