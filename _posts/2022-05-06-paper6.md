# BIM-based Variant Retrieval of Building Designs Using Case-based Reasoning and Pattern Matching
###### _Vol. 38,  Waterloo: IAARC Publications. (2021): 435-442._

This paper proposes an idea about variant retrieval in early design phases. They used IFC data from BIM and made that data into a graph-based representation. They used CBR (case-based reasoning) and PM (pattern matching). For similarity checking, they adopted a formula from Hemming. For the CBR method, they specified entities and attributes from IFC data. They valued similarity determination with their own criterion. They also selected weights for each entity. From 3 different building plans (one is a problem description of the use, and the others were variants), they concluded that they could measure similarities between those plans. Moreover, they gave a further solution for users who are unsatisfied with those variants, to search for possible alternatives to the variant types from Neo4j.

From this paper, I wondered about the reason why they chose those values, weights, and the similarity formula. Moreover, I was confused about the usage of the graph database because it was only used for changing the option and this paper had limited data.
